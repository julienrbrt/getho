# Getho

Getho is dumb tool that is going to generate random private keys, fetch the associated ethereum address and check its balance.
Getho creates a file `result.txt` as soon that it finds an address with a balance greather than 0.001 eth. If the fine cannot be created, Getho will stop and display the address found.

**Disclaimer**
Even if you have less chance than getting striked by a lightning than finding an address with a balance,
I am not responsible of your actions if you manage to find an address with a balance.
This program was made for fun purpose only and should not be used for stealing funds.
